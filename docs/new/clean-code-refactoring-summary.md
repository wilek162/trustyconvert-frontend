# Clean Code Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring performed to improve separation of concerns (SoC) and clean code principles in the session management and API client modules of the TrustyConvert frontend application.

## Issues Identified

1. **Circular Dependencies**: `client.ts` depended on `sessionManager.ts` and vice versa, creating circular dependencies.
2. **Duplicate Responsibilities**: Session initialization logic was duplicated between `_apiClient.ts`, `client.ts`, and `sessionManager.ts`.
3. **Mixed Concerns**: `sessionManager.ts` was handling both state management and API calls.
4. **Unclear Boundaries**: The responsibilities between the three modules were not clearly defined.

## Refactoring Approach

### 1. Clear Separation of Responsibilities

We established clear boundaries for each module:

- **_apiClient.ts**: Low-level HTTP requests only
- **sessionManager.ts**: Session state management only
- **client.ts**: Public API for components that coordinates between _apiClient and sessionManager

### 2. Breaking Circular Dependencies

- Removed the dependency on `client.ts` from `sessionManager.ts`
- Made `sessionManager.ts` focus solely on state management
- Moved all API call logic to `client.ts`

### 3. Simplified Session Management

- `sessionManager.ts` now only manages state and provides utility functions
- `client.ts` handles session initialization and coordinates with `_apiClient.ts`
- Components now interact primarily with `client.ts` for API calls

### 4. Improved Error Handling

- Centralized error handling in `client.ts`
- Better separation of network errors vs. state management errors

## Key Changes

### In sessionManager.ts

1. Removed API calls and dependencies on client.ts
2. Added utility methods for session state management
3. Simplified the API to focus on state management only

### In client.ts

1. Added session initialization logic that was previously in sessionManager.ts
2. Improved error handling and retry logic
3. Added session state checking before making API calls

### In _apiClient.ts

1. Simplified to focus only on HTTP requests
2. Removed session management logic
3. Made it a pure HTTP client without business logic

## Benefits

1. **Clearer Code Organization**: Each module has a single responsibility
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Session initialization logic is now in one place
3. **Better Testability**: Modules can be tested in isolation
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to one aspect don't require changes across multiple files
5. **Performance Optimization**: Reduced unnecessary API calls by checking state first

## Usage Example

Before:
```typescript
// Component needs to manually check session state
if (!sessionManager.hasCsrfToken()) {
  await sessionManager.initSession();
}
const response = await _apiClient.uploadFile(file);
```

After:
```typescript
// client.ts handles session checking internally
const response = await client.uploadFile(file);
```

## Conclusion

This refactoring has significantly improved the code organization by applying proper separation of concerns. The code is now more maintainable, easier to understand, and follows clean code principles more closely. The changes also optimize performance by reducing unnecessary API calls and providing a cleaner interface for components to interact with.
