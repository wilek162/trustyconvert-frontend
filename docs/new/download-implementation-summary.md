# Download Implementation Fixes

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the download functionality in the TrustyConvert frontend application. The main issues addressed were:

1. Separation of concerns violations with multiple modules calling the download token endpoint
2. Incorrect use of ReadableStream for downloads instead of the recommended approach
3. CORS errors when attempting to download files
4. Missing proper error handling

## Changes Made

### 1. Download Service Refactoring

The `downloadService.ts` has been completely refactored to:

- Separate token retrieval from download initiation
- Use the recommended `<a>` tag approach for downloads instead of ReadableStream
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Provide clear interfaces for other components to use

Key functions:
- `getDownloadToken`: Solely responsible for obtaining a valid download token
- `initiateDownload`: Handles the actual download using the proper approach
- `downloadFile`: Combines token retrieval and download initiation
- `checkDownloadStatus`: Checks if a file is ready for download

### 2. Job Polling Service Refactoring

The `jobPollingService.ts` has been updated to:

- Focus solely on job status monitoring
- Remove download token generation logic
- Return job completion status to the caller
- Maintain proper separation of concerns

Key changes:
- Updated the `onCompleted` callback to provide the job ID instead of download token
- Removed download token generation logic from the service
- Improved error handling and logging

### 3. DownloadManager Component Updates

The `DownloadManager.tsx` component has been updated to:

- Use the new download service functions
- Remove direct usage of streaming download
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Follow the recommended download approach

### 4. ConversionFlow Component Updates

The `ConversionFlow.tsx` component has been updated to:

- Handle the transition from job polling to download state
- Use the download service to retrieve tokens when a job completes
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Provide better error handling and user feedback

### 5. Testing

A simple test script has been created to validate the download functionality:
- `test/download-test.js`: Tests the download flow from job completion to file download
- `run-download-test.sh`: Shell script to run the test

## How to Test

1. Run the test script:
   ```
   ./run-download-test.sh
   ```

2. Test in the browser:
   - Start the development server
   - Upload a file for conversion
   - Wait for the conversion to complete
   - Click the download button
   - Verify that the file downloads correctly

## Expected Behavior

1. When a conversion job completes:
   - The job polling service notifies the conversion flow
   - The conversion flow requests a download token from the download service
   - The conversion state is updated with the token and URL
   - The UI transitions to the download state

2. When the user clicks the download button:
   - The download service initiates the download using the `<a>` tag approach
   - The file download starts automatically in the browser
   - The UI shows appropriate feedback

3. If any errors occur:
   - User-friendly error messages are displayed
   - Retry options are provided
   - Detailed errors are logged for debugging

## Troubleshooting

If downloads still fail:

1. Check the browser console for CORS errors
2. Verify that the API server is properly configured to allow downloads
3. Check that the download token is valid and not expired
4. Ensure the session is properly initialized before attempting downloads

## Future Improvements

1. Add download progress tracking using the Fetch API's progress events
2. Implement token refresh logic for long-running downloads
3. Add support for downloading multiple files at once
4. Improve error recovery for failed downloads
