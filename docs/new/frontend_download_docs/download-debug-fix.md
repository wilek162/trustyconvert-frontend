# Download Authentication Debug & Fix

## Issue Identified

When testing the enhanced download flow, we encountered an error: "Failed to get download token" when clicking the download button. The browser logs and network requests revealed the following sequence of events:

1. The conversion process completed successfully
2. The job status was updated to "completed"
3. A download token was successfully obtained during job polling
4. The UI updated to the download state correctly
5. When the user clicked the download button, the `useEnhancedDownload` hook tried to get a new download token
6. This second token request failed with the error: "Failed to get download token"

## Root Cause

The root issue was that we were requesting a download token twice:

1. Once during the job polling process (which succeeded)
2. Again when the user clicked the download button (which failed)

The backend was rejecting the second token request because:

- The token is single-use and already issued for this job
- The backend likely has rate limiting or restrictions on multiple token requests for the same job

## Solution Implemented

We modified the `useEnhancedDownload` hook to check if a download token already exists for the job before requesting a new one:

```typescript
// Check if we already have a download token for this job
const jobData = getJob(jobId)
let downloadToken = jobData?.downloadToken

// If no token exists in the job store, request a new one
if (!downloadToken) {
	debugLog('No existing download token found, requesting new token for job:', jobId)

	// Get download token
	const response = await apiClient.getDownloadToken(jobId)

	// ... process response ...
} else {
	debugLog('Using existing download token for job:', jobId)
}
```

Additionally, we improved the download page to:

1. Provide better error handling and more detailed error messages
2. Show intermediate status updates during the download process
3. Include helpful troubleshooting suggestions when errors occur

## Testing Verification

After implementing these changes, the download flow works correctly:

1. When a job completes, a download token is requested and stored
2. When the user clicks the download button:
   - The existing token is reused instead of requesting a new one
   - The user is redirected to the download page
   - The download page uses the token to fetch the file with proper authentication

## Key Lessons

1. **Token Reuse**: Download tokens should be reused when available rather than requesting new ones
2. **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages help diagnose issues quickly
3. **User Experience**: Status updates during the download process improve user experience
4. **Debugging**: Comprehensive logging helps identify issues in complex flows

## Future Improvements

1. **Token Expiration Handling**: Implement logic to check if an existing token has expired and request a new one if needed
2. **Download Progress**: Add progress tracking for large file downloads
3. **Offline Support**: Implement offline support for downloaded files
4. **Retry Logic**: Add more sophisticated retry logic for failed downloads
