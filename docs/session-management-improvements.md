# Session Management Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the session management system to fix authentication issues and ensure reliable session handling.

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing authentication errors (401 Unauthorized) during API calls, particularly when uploading files. The root cause was identified as:

1. Empty `expiresAt` field in the session data, causing session validation to fail
2. Inadequate handling of session expiration and refresh
3. Missing fallback mechanisms for invalid session states

## Solution Overview

We implemented several improvements to the session management system:

### 1. Default Expiration Handling

- Added a `generateDefaultExpiration()` function to create a valid expiration date when the API doesn't provide one
- Updated the session initialization logic to ensure an expiration date is always set

### 2. Improved Session Validation

- Enhanced the `isSessionValid()` function to handle empty or invalid expiration dates
- Added better validation for session state, including proper error handling for invalid dates
- Improved logging for session validation issues to aid in debugging

### 3. Proactive Session Refresh

- Implemented a periodic session validation check in the `useSessionInitializer` hook
- Added a timer-based refresh mechanism in the `SessionProvider` component
- Enhanced the `checkSessionRefresh()` function to handle various edge cases

### 4. Better Error Recovery

- Improved handling of 401/403 errors to automatically attempt session refresh
- Added automatic session reset when authentication fails
- Enhanced error messages to provide better feedback to users

## Implementation Details

### Session Manager Changes

- Added default expiration date generation
- Improved session refresh logic to handle various edge cases
- Enhanced error handling for session initialization failures

### Session Store Changes

- Improved validation logic to handle empty or invalid expiration dates
- Added better error logging for session validation issues

### React Integration Changes

- Added periodic session validation in the `useSessionInitializer` hook
- Implemented a timer-based refresh mechanism in the `SessionProvider`
- Enhanced error recovery for authentication failures

## Testing

A test script (`test-session-validation.js`) was created to validate the session management improvements. The script tests:

1. Session initialization
2. Session validation
3. Session refresh
4. API calls with the session

## Future Improvements

1. Implement a more robust session recovery mechanism for network failures
2. Add telemetry to track session-related errors and performance
3. Consider implementing a background refresh mechanism using service workers
