# ðŸ“ˆ TrustyConvert Scaling & Growth Strategy

## Overview

TrustyConvert is designed as a modular microservice architecture with the core API, background workers (Celery), Redis broker, antivirus scanning (ClamAV), document conversion (UnoServer), and optional auxiliary services. Scaling must balance cost efficiency with user experience and security, especially considering premium user tiers.

## 1. Scaling Principles

- **Modularity**: Each service runs independently in Docker containers. This enables scaling individual services based on their load.

- **Stateless API**: API instances should be stateless, enabling horizontal scaling behind load balancers.

- **Shared Storage**: Use shared Docker volumes or external storage (e.g., NFS, S3-compatible storage) for file persistence across instances.

- **Async Processing**: Heavy processing (file conversion, virus scanning) offloaded to Celery workers to avoid blocking API responsiveness.

- **Session & Cache**: Use Redis as a centralized cache/session store, supporting multiple API and worker instances.

## 2. Current Budget-Conscious Setup

- **Single Docker host or small VM**:
  - Run all services on a single machine with resource limits per container.
  - Use Docker Compose for easy management.

- **Lightweight Redis and Celery**: One Redis and a limited number of Celery workers.

- **Shared volume for temporary files**, keeping disk I/O efficient.

- **API with SSL termination** inside the container to reduce infrastructure complexity (no external reverse proxy yet).

- **ClamAV and UnoServer** running as sidecars in the same environment for simplicity.

## 3. Scaling the API Layer

### 3.1 Horizontal Scaling API Containers

- Run multiple API containers behind a load balancer (e.g., NGINX, Traefik).
- Each API instance is stateless; all session info and temporary file metadata stored in Redis and shared volumes.
- Use sticky sessions only if session affinity is needed; otherwise prefer token-based stateless authentication.

### 3.2 Authentication & Premium User Support

- Implement JWT tokens for stateless authentication.
- Use API keys or JWT claims for premium user tiers, controlling access limits and features.
- Premium users can have:
  - Higher file size limits.
  - Faster queue priority (via Celery task priorities or separate worker pools).
  - Additional API endpoints or enhanced concurrency.

## 4. Scaling Background Workers (Celery)

- Run multiple Celery worker containers on the same or separate hosts.
- Use task queues with priorities or separate Celery queues (e.g., default, premium) to ensure premium tasks are processed faster.
- Workers can be scaled dynamically based on Redis queue length and CPU load.
- Use resource limits to prevent overloading the host machine.

## 5. Scaling Redis

- For small deployments, a single Redis instance is sufficient.
- As load grows:
  - Use Redis replication and sentinel for high availability.
  - Consider managed Redis services (e.g., AWS Elasticache, Redis Cloud) for scaling and reliability.
- Monitor memory usage and latency closely, as Redis is critical for session state and Celery messaging.

## 6. Scaling Conversion Services (UnoServer, Poppler, ClamAV)

- Run multiple UnoServer instances behind an internal load balancer if high document conversion throughput is needed.
- For Poppler and other CLI tools embedded inside the API container, consider moving them to dedicated microservices if CPU intensive.
- ClamAV virus scanning can be scaled horizontally by:
  - Running multiple ClamAV containers.
  - Load balancing scan requests.
- Use shared storage to pass files to these services.

## 7. Storage Considerations

- Shared volume via Docker works well initially.
- For scale:
  - Move temporary and session files to a network-attached storage or cloud storage bucket.
  - Ensure file cleanup policies to avoid storage bloat.
- Use caching headers or CDN for delivering converted files if serving to users.

## 8. Networking and Security

- Use Docker networks to isolate internal services.
- Keep non-public ports unexposed.
- Scale SSL termination via a dedicated reverse proxy (NGINX, Traefik) for better certificate management and HTTPS handling.
- Protect API with rate limiting and IP whitelisting as needed.
- Monitor security logs and add alerts for suspicious activity.

## 9. Monitoring & Auto-Scaling

- Deploy lightweight monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana or cloud alternatives).
- Monitor:
  - API request rate, latency.
  - Celery queue depth and worker CPU.
  - Redis memory and latency.
  - Disk usage and I/O.
- Use simple scripts or cloud-based triggers to scale containers based on:
  - Queue length thresholds.
  - CPU/memory usage.

## 10. Roadmap for Future Growth

| Stage | Action | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Initial | Single Docker host with Compose and minimal replicas | Budget-friendly, simple setup |
| Early Growth | Add load balancer for API, multiple Celery workers | Add JWT auth, API keys |
| Mid Growth | Migrate storage to cloud/NFS, add Redis HA | Add task prioritization |
| Advanced | Multi-host Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for full scaling | Use managed Redis, external DB |
| Premium Features | Separate premium worker queues, faster priority handling | Usage-based billing, feature flags |

## Summary

TrustyConvert's design allows easy horizontal scaling of stateless API and asynchronous worker components while keeping shared storage and Redis central. The priority is to maintain a simple setup for now and progressively introduce complexity only as usage and budget allow.
