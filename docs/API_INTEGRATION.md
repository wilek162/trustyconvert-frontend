# TrustyConvert API Integration Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of the API integration between the TrustyConvert frontend and backend services.

## Overview

The integration follows the specifications in the [API Integration Guide](../API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) and implements the complete file conversion workflow:

1. Session initialization and CSRF token management
2. File upload
3. Format conversion
4. Job status polling
5. Download token retrieval
6. File download

## Implementation Components

### API Client Layer

- **`src/lib/api/apiClient.ts`**: Low-level API client that handles direct communication with the backend API.
- **`src/lib/api/client.ts`**: Higher-level API client that provides a simplified interface for components.
- **`src/lib/api/config.ts`**: Centralized configuration for API endpoints and settings.

### Session Management

- **`src/lib/hooks/useSessionInitializer.ts`**: React hook that handles session initialization.
- **`src/lib/stores/session.ts`**: State management for session data.
- **`src/lib/utils/csrfUtils.ts`**: Utilities for CSRF token management.

### Conversion Flow Components

- **`src/components/features/conversion/ConversionFlow.tsx`**: Main component that orchestrates the entire conversion process.
- **`src/components/features/conversion/FormatSelector.tsx`**: Component for selecting the target format.
- **`src/components/features/conversion/ConversionStats.tsx`**: Component for displaying conversion statistics.
- **`src/components/features/conversion/ConversionProgress.tsx`**: Component for displaying conversion progress.
- **`src/components/features/upload/UploadZone.tsx`**: Component for handling file uploads.
- **`src/components/features/conversion/DownloadManager.tsx`**: Component for handling secure download token retrieval and file download.

## Download Flow Implementation

The download process follows these steps:

1. **Token Retrieval**: When a conversion job completes, the `DownloadManager` component requests a secure download token from the API using the `getDownloadToken` function.
2. **Token Storage**: The download token is stored in the upload store using `setJobDownloadToken` for potential reuse.
3. **Download URL Construction**: A secure download URL is constructed using the API configuration: `${apiConfig.baseUrl}${apiConfig.endpoints.download}?token=${token}`.
4. **Download Initiation**: The user clicks the download button, which opens the download URL.
5. **Token Expiration**: Download tokens are short-lived (10 minutes) and single-use for security.

## Security Implementation

### CSRF Protection

The implementation uses the Double Submit Cookie pattern for CSRF protection:

1. The server sets a CSRF token in a cookie during session initialization.
2. The client extracts this token and sends it in the `X-CSRF-Token` header for all state-changing requests.
3. The server validates that the token in the header matches the one in the cookie.

### Cookie Management

- Cookies are sent with the `credentials: 'include'` option for all API requests.
- The session cookie is managed by the browser and server.
- The CSRF token is stored both in a cookie and in memory for validation.

### Secure Downloads

- Download tokens are single-use and short-lived.
- Tokens are bound to specific sessions and job IDs.
- The download endpoint is protected by the token validation.
- File downloads use proper Content-Disposition headers for security.

## Error Handling

- Centralized error handling in the API client.
- Typed error responses for different error scenarios (network, validation, session).
- User-friendly error messages displayed in the UI.
- Correlation IDs tracked for debugging.
- Retry mechanisms for transient errors with exponential backoff.

## Data Persistence

- Job information is stored in IndexedDB for persistence across page refreshes.
- Download tokens are cached to allow redownloading without requesting new tokens.
- Session information is maintained in memory and cookies.

## Testing

Two testing approaches are implemented:

1. **Manual Testing Page**: `src/pages/convert/test-api.astro` provides a UI for testing the API integration.
2. **Automated Test Script**: `test-api-integration.js` runs a headless test of the complete API flow.

## Usage Example

```tsx
// Example usage of the ConversionFlow component
import { ConversionFlow } from '@/components/features/conversion';

function ConversionPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Convert Your File</h1>
      <ConversionFlow />
    </div>
  );
}

// Example usage of the DownloadManager component
import { DownloadManager } from '@/components/features/conversion';

function DownloadPage({ jobId }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Download Your Converted File</h1>
      <DownloadManager jobId={jobId} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Type Safety**: All API responses and requests are fully typed.
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages.
3. **Session Management**: Automatic session initialization and CSRF token management.
4. **Modular Design**: Components are modular and reusable.
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: The UI provides feedback during all stages of the conversion process.
6. **Security**: CSRF protection, secure cookie handling, and input validation.
7. **Configuration**: Centralized API configuration for easy updates.
8. **Cross-Origin Support**: Proper CORS handling with credentials.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement batch conversion support when the API supports it.
2. Add file preview functionality.
3. Enhance error recovery mechanisms.
4. Implement offline support with upload queue.
5. Add analytics tracking for conversion metrics.
6. Implement download resumability for large files.
7. Add support for direct sharing of converted files.
