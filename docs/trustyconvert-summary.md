   - Added proper logo files and branding elements

4. **CORS and Network Handling**
   - Resolved CORS issues with proper fetch interceptor configuration
   - Added development proxy settings for local testing
   - Improved error handling for network requests

5. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation of the frontend implementation
   - Documented session management and security features
   - Provided detailed explanation of the file conversion workflow

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a component-based architecture with:

```
TrustyConvert Frontend
├── Pages (Astro)
│   └── index.astro (Main conversion page)
├── Components (React)
│   ├── Features
│   │   ├── conversion/ (Conversion flow components)

│   └── utils/ (Utility functions)

```

## Key Components

### ConversionFlow

The main component that orchestrates the entire conversion process:
- Manages the conversion steps (select, upload, convert, download)
- Integrates with the API client for backend communication
- Handles errors and provides user feedback

### UploadZone

Handles file selection and upload:
- Provides drag-and-drop interface
- Validates files before upload
- Shows upload progress
- Manages the upload API call

### SessionManager

Manages and displays session information:
- Shows session status and time remaining
- Provides option to close the session
- Offers conversion history export

### API Client

Centralizes all backend communication:
- Handles CSRF token management
- Provides standardized error handling
- Implements request retries and timeouts
- Manages session cookies and authentication

## How It All Works Together

1. **Application Initialization**
   - The app initializes on page load
   - A secure session is established with the backend
   - UI components are rendered

2. **User Interaction**
   - User selects a file for conversion
   - File is validated and uploaded
   - User selects target format
   - Conversion is initiated

3. **Backend Processing**
   - Backend converts the file
   - Frontend polls for status updates
   - Progress is displayed to the user

4. **File Delivery**
   - When conversion is complete, a download token is requested
   - User downloads the converted file
   - Resources are cleaned up (automatically or manually)

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **TypeScript Type Warning**
   - There is a type mismatch warning for structured data in `index.astro`
   - This is a TypeScript typing issue, not a runtime bug
   - The structured data is still rendered correctly for SEO

2. **Progress Tracking**
   - Upload progress is simulated for better UX
   - Real progress tracking would require server-side support

3. **Session Time Tracking**
   - Session start time is estimated on the client side
   - For more accurate timing, the backend should provide the exact session creation time

## Next Steps for Future Development

1. **Enhanced Error Recovery**
   - Add more robust error recovery options
   - Implement automatic retry for failed conversions

2. **Batch Processing**
   - Support for converting multiple files at once
   - Queue management for batch operations

3. **User Accounts (Optional)**
   - Add optional user accounts for premium features
   - Persistent conversion history for registered users

4. **Offline Support**
   - Implement progressive web app features
   - Add offline queue for conversions

5. **Analytics and Monitoring**
   - Add detailed usage analytics
   - Implement performance monitoring

## Development Environment Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Build for production**

## Conclusion

The TrustyConvert frontend is now fully implemented with all core features working as expected. The application provides a secure, user-friendly experience for file conversion without requiring user registration or storing files permanently. Future development can focus on enhancing the existing features and adding new capabilities while maintaining the current security and privacy standards.
