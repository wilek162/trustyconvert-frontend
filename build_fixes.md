## Issues Fixed

### 1. Component Import Paths

- Updated `DownloadManager.tsx` to use both default and named exports
- Updated `ConversionFlow.tsx` to use both default and named exports
- Updated `ConversionProgress.tsx` to use both default and named exports

### 3. Component Organization 
- Moved `ConversionStats.tsx` to the features/conversion directory
- Updated barrel exports in `features/conversion/index.ts` to include all components
- Removed original component files after relocating them

### 4. TypeScript Fixes
- Fixed JobStatus import in ConversionFlow.tsx to use type import from correct location
- Fixed @tanstack/react-query type imports by using explicit type imports

## Remaining Warnings

There are a few non-critical warnings that do not affect the build:

1. **Dynamic Import Warnings**: Several modules are both dynamically imported and statically imported. These are just informational and don't affect functionality:
   - src/lib/stores/session.ts
   - src/lib/api/apiClient.ts 
   - src/lib/stores/upload.ts

## Build Verification

The application now builds successfully with:

```
pnpm run build
```

All pages are generated correctly and the static site is ready for deployment.
