# TrustyConvert Frontend Integration Plan

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented the core functionality and advanced features of TrustyConvert according to the requirements. Here's what we've accomplished:

### Core Architecture

- Astro v5.9.1 in static output mode
- React components for interactive elements
- TypeScript throughout
- Tailwind CSS + radix-ui/ui for styling
- nanostores for state management
- IndexedDB for job persistence
- MSW for API mocking in development

### Core Components

- ✅ FileUploadZone: Drag & drop interface with validation
- ✅ ConversionInterface: Format selection and conversion
- ✅ DownloadManager: Secure token-based download
- ✅ FileConverter: Integration of all components with workflow

### Advanced Components (Prompt 3)

- ✅ JobHistoryPanel: Display recent conversions from IndexedDB
- ✅ ConversionProgress: Animated visualization with time estimates
- ✅ SessionManager: Session tracking and cleanup

### Enhanced Pages

- ✅ Download Status Page: Detailed view with sharing options
- ✅ Privacy Page: Detailed privacy policy with conversion tracking info

### Technical Features

- ✅ Smart Polling Strategy: Adaptive intervals
- ✅ IndexedDB Integration: Persistent job history
- ✅ CSRF Protection: In-memory token handling
- ✅ API Client: Comprehensive error handling

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Resolve Path Aliases

- Fix import path aliases in various components
- Consider implementing a consistent path strategy (relative vs. alias)
- Update tsconfig.json to ensure proper path resolution

### 2. Testing

- Implement unit tests for core components
- Add integration tests for workflow
- Test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile responsiveness testing

### 3. Performance Optimizations

- Implement lazy loading for non-critical components
- Add code splitting for larger bundles
- Optimize image assets
- Implement proper caching headers

### 4. Accessibility Improvements

- Add proper ARIA labels to all interactive elements
- Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout the application
- Test with screen readers
- Implement proper focus management

### 5. Error Handling Enhancements

- Implement global error boundary
- Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Improve error messages for better UX
- Add offline support/detection

### 6. Deployment Configuration

- Set up production build pipeline
- Configure proper headers (CSP, cache, etc.)
- Implement monitoring and error tracking
- Set up CI/CD pipeline

### 7. Documentation

- Create developer documentation
- Add JSDoc comments to key functions
- Document API integration points
- Create user guide

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Core Stability

- Resolve path alias issues
- Fix any remaining linting errors
- Implement unit tests for core components
- Improve error handling

### Week 2: User Experience

- Implement accessibility improvements
- Add keyboard shortcuts
- Enhance mobile experience
- Implement toast notifications

### Week 3: Performance & Production Readiness

- Implement performance optimizations
- Set up production deployment configuration
- Add monitoring and error tracking
- Complete documentation

## Integration Points

The frontend communicates with the backend API through these key endpoints:

1. `GET /session/init` - Initialize secure session and get CSRF token
2. `POST /upload` - Upload file with progress tracking
3. `POST /convert` - Start conversion process
4. `GET /job_status` - Poll for job status
5. `POST /download_token` - Get secure download token
6. `GET /download` - Download converted file
7. `POST /session/close` - Close session and clean up resources

## Security Considerations

- CSRF tokens are stored in memory, never in localStorage
- Session cookies are HttpOnly and Secure
- Download tokens have limited validity (10 minutes)
- File validation happens on both client and server
- Clear error messages without leaking system information

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Run linting and fix all errors
- [ ] Run tests and ensure all pass
- [ ] Check bundle size and optimize if needed
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set
- [ ] Configure proper CSP headers
- [ ] Set up monitoring and error tracking
- [ ] Create backup and rollback plan
- [ ] Test in production-like environment
- [ ] Deploy to staging
- [ ] Conduct final testing on staging
- [ ] Deploy to production

This plan will ensure a complete, secure, and maintainable implementation of the TrustyConvert frontend that meets all the requirements specified in the project documentation.
