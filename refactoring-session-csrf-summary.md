# TrustyConvert Frontend: Session & CSRF Refactoring Summary

## Current State

The frontend codebase has been refactored to use server-managed sessions and CSRF protection, following best practices and the TrustyConvert API documentation.

### Key Changes

- **Removed all client-side session management logic** (including `initializeApi.ts`)
- **AppProviders** and **app.ts** no longer initialize sessions on the client
- **Session and CSRF tokens** are now managed by the server via cookies
- **Frontend components** (SessionProvider, CloseSession, etc.) updated to use the new approach

### Security Model

- **Session**: Managed by the server using HTTP-only cookies
- **CSRF**: Double cookie method; CSRF token is set in a JavaScript-accessible cookie and sent in the `X-CSRF-Token` header for non-GET requests

## Build & Warnings

- **Build is successful**
- Some warnings about `Astro.request.headers` on prerendered pages (can be ignored for now, but consider updating affected pages)
- Circular dependency warning for `ConversionFlow` (does not break build, but should be reviewed)
- During static build, session validation errors are expected (no session during build)

## Next Steps

1. **SessionManager Component**
   - Review and simplify further if needed
   - Remove any remaining legacy session logic

2. **API Client**
   - Ensure all requests requiring CSRF use the token from cookies
   - Handle session/CSRF errors with user-friendly messages and retry logic

3. **Error Handling**
   - Ensure session expiration and CSRF errors are handled gracefully in the UI

4. **Astro Headers Warnings**
   - Consider adding `export const prerender = false;` to pages that require request headers
   - Or update code to handle missing headers gracefully

5. **Documentation**
   - Update developer docs to reflect the new session/CSRF approach

6. **Testing**
   - Test session initialization, CSRF protection, session expiration, and session closing in the browser

The codebase is now more secure, maintainable, and aligned with modern best practices for session and CSRF management.
