# Session Management Fixes

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to fix session initialization and CSRF token management issues in the TrustyConvert frontend application. The main issue was related to how the application was handling CSRF tokens and session state.

## Key Changes

### 1. CSRF Token Management

- **Removed direct cookie access**: Modified the `getCsrfTokenFromStore` function to only check the nanostore for tokens, not browser cookies.
- **Simplified token retrieval**: Updated the session store to rely solely on the nanostore for token storage and retrieval.
- **Renamed methods for clarity**: Changed `synchronizeTokenFromCookie` to `checkTokenInStore` to better reflect its purpose.

### 2. Session Store Updates

- **Simplified token checking**: Updated `hasCsrfToken()` to only check the nanostore, not attempt to retrieve from cookies.
- **Improved initialization logic**: Updated the store initialization to properly handle token state without relying on cookies.
- **Removed redundant cookie checks**: Eliminated unnecessary cookie access that could cause issues with cross-domain restrictions.

### 3. Session Context Component

- **Updated method references**: Fixed the SessionContext component to use the correct method names (`checkTokenInStore` instead of `synchronizeTokenFromServer`).
- **Improved comments**: Updated comments to reflect the new approach of not relying on cookies directly.
- **Simplified debug info**: Removed references to cookie-based token detection in debug information.

## Benefits

1. **More reliable session management**: By centralizing token storage in the nanostore, we avoid issues with cross-domain cookie access.
2. **Clearer code**: The renamed methods and updated comments make the code more maintainable and easier to understand.
3. **Reduced complexity**: Removing direct cookie access simplifies the code and reduces potential points of failure.

## Testing

The changes have been tested by:
1. Running a full build to ensure no TypeScript or linting errors
2. Testing the application in development mode to verify session initialization works correctly
3. Verifying that CSRF tokens are properly managed for API requests

## Future Considerations

- Consider implementing a more robust session recovery mechanism if the server rejects a stored CSRF token
- Add more comprehensive logging for session-related events to help with debugging
- Consider adding automated tests specifically for session management functionality
