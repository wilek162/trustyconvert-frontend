					TrustyConvert is a secure, privacy-focused file conversion service designed to make
					converting files between formats fast, easy, and worry-free.
				</p>

				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				<p>
					We believe that file conversion should be simple, secure, and respectful of your privacy.
					Our mission is to provide a reliable conversion service that prioritizes security and
					transparency.
				</p>

				<h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>

				<h3>Privacy First</h3>
				<p>
					Unlike many other conversion services, we never store your files permanently. All files
					are automatically deleted after conversion is complete or after 24 hours, whichever comes
					first.
				</p>

				<h3>Lightning Fast</h3>
				<p>
					Our optimized conversion engine processes your files in seconds, not minutes. We've built
					our infrastructure to handle conversions quickly and efficiently.
				</p>

				<h3>Professional-Grade Security</h3>
				<p>
					We use bank-level encryption for all file transfers and process your files in secure,
					isolated environments. Your data never leaves our secure processing pipeline.
				</p>

				<h3>No Registration Required</h3>
				<p>
					We don't require you to create an account or provide personal information. Just upload
					your file, convert it, and download the result.
				</p>

				<h2>Our Technology</h2>
				<p>TrustyConvert is built on modern, reliable technology:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Secure file processing with industry-standard encryption</li>
					<li>High-performance conversion engines for all supported formats</li>
					<li>Scalable infrastructure that grows with demand</li>
					<li>Regular security audits and updates</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Supported Formats</h2>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Documents:</strong> PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT, RTF, ODT</li>
