				<p class="lead">
					At TrustyConvert, we prioritize your privacy and data security. This policy explains how
					we handle your files during the conversion process.
				</p>

				<h2>No File Storage Policy</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Your files are never permanently stored.</strong> All uploaded files are automatically
					deleted from our servers immediately after conversion is complete or after 24 hours, whichever
					comes first.
				</p>

				<h2>Data Processing</h2>
				<p>
					When you use our service, we temporarily process your files solely for the purpose of
					conversion. This processing happens in a secure, isolated environment.
				</p>

				<h3>What we collect:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Temporary file data (deleted after conversion)</li>
					<li>Basic conversion metrics (file types, sizes)</li>
					<li>Anonymous usage statistics</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>What we don't collect:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Personal information</li>
					<li>File contents or metadata</li>
					<li>User accounts or credentials</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
				<p>
					We use a single session cookie for security purposes and local browser storage to remember
					your recent conversions. No tracking cookies are used.
				</p>

				<h2>Security Measures</h2>
				<p>
					All file transfers use TLS encryption. Our conversion process runs in isolated containers
					with strict security controls.
				</p>

				<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
				<p>
					We use minimal third-party services for infrastructure and monitoring. None of these
					services have access to your file contents.
				</p>

				<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
				<p>
					We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this
					page.
				</p>
